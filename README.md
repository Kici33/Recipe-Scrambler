# Recipe Scrambler
Minecraft plugin for 1.12 and above which making that every recipe has a new output.
Idea for plugin is from Graf series "Strumykowo". Sorry for messy code.

### Install
Click Releases and download .jar file > put into your plugins folder.

### Config
In config you will find 2 values.
First one is seed which is making that recipe after restarting server is not changing.
Second one are exceptions. If you are casual and want to have a normal recipe for workbench just add it to exception list.
### Credits:
Graf - His series "Strumykowo" was idea for this plugin.
